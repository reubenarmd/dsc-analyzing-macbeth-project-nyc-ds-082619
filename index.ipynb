    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now we're going to do some rudimentry analysis of Shakespeare's classic play: Macbeth! You will get practice working with lists, condtionals and dictionaries, visualizing data, and thinking analytically about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Show mastery of the content covered in this section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "Here we start by importing a python package and using it to pull the transcript of Macbeth from the project Gutenberg website. We also preview a few details about what is now stored in the variable macbeth; it's a string with 119,846 characters, the first 500 of which are printed below. "

    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common python programming pattern to counting objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `dictionary.get()` method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the dictionary.get() method and use it along with the pseudocode above to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into a variable 'Macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph."

A Camp near Forres.\\r\\n\\r\\n Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with\\r\\n Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nWhat bloody man is that? He can report,\\r\\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\\r\\nThe newest state.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nThis is the sergeant\\r\\nWho, like a good and hardy soldier, fought\\r\\n’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!\\r\\nSay to the King the knowledge of the broil\\r\\nAs thou didst leave it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSOLDIER.\\r\\nDoubtful it stood;\\r\\nAs two spent swimmers that do cling together\\r\\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\\r\\n(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\\r\\nThe multiplying villainies of nature\\r\\nDo swarm upon him) from the Western Isles\\r\\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\\r\\nAnd Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\\r\\nShow’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;\\r\\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\\r\\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,\\r\\nWhich smok’d with bloody execution,\\r\\nLike Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,\\r\\nTill he fac’d the slave;\\r\\nWhich ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\\r\\nTill he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,\\r\\nAnd fix’d his head upon our battlements.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\\r\\n\\r\\nSOLDIER.\\r\\nAs whence the sun ’gins his reflection\\r\\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\\r\\nSo from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come\\r\\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\\r\\nNo sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,\\r\\nCompell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\\r\\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\\r\\nWith furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,\\r\\nBegan a fresh assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nDismay’d not this\\r\\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\\r\\n\\r\\nSOLDIER.\\r\\nYes;\\r\\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\\r\\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\\r\\nAs cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;\\r\\nSo they\\r\\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\\r\\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\\r\\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\\r\\nI cannot tell—\\r\\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\\r\\nThey smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Captain, attended._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Ross and Angus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nThe worthy Thane of Ross.\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\\r\\nThat seems to speak things strange.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nGod save the King!\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nWhence cam’st thou, worthy thane?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nFrom Fife, great King,\\r\\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky\\r\\nAnd fan our people cold.\\r\\nNorway himself, with terrible numbers,\\r\\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor,\\r\\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\\r\\nTill that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,\\r\\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\\r\\nPoint against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,\\r\\nCurbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\\r\\nThe victory fell on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nGreat happiness!\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nThat now\\r\\nSweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;\\r\\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\\r\\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch\\r\\nTen thousand dollars to our general use.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nNo more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\\r\\nOur bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,\\r\\nAnd with his former title greet Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nI’ll see it done.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nWhat he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.

You seem to understand me,\\r\\nBy each at once her choppy finger laying\\r\\nUpon her skinny lips. You should be women,\\r\\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\\r\\nThat you are so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nSpeak, if you can;—what are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST WITCH.\\r\\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND WITCH.\\r\\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\r\\nAll hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nGood sir, why do you start and seem to fear\\r\\nThings that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,\\r\\nAre ye fantastical, or that indeed\\r\\nWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partner\\r\\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\\r\\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\\r\\nThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\\r\\nIf you can look into the seeds of time,\\r\\nAnd say which grain will grow, and which will not,\\r\\nSpeak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\\r\\nYour favours nor your hate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST WITCH.\\r\\nHail!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND WITCH.\\r\\nHail!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\r\\nHail!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST WITCH.\\r\\nLesser than Macbeth, and greater.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND WITCH.\\r\\nNot so happy, yet much happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\r\\nThou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\\r\\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST WITCH.\\r\\nBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nStay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.\\r\\nBy Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;\\r\\nBut how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,\\r\\nA prosperous gentleman; and to be king\\r\\nStands not within the prospect of belief,\\r\\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\\r\\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\\r\\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\\r\\nWith such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Witches vanish._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\\r\\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nInto the air; and what seem’d corporal,\\r\\nMelted as breath into the wind.\\r\\nWould they had stay’d!\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\\r\\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\\r\\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nYour children shall be kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nYou shall be king.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nAnd Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nTo the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Ross and Angus.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nThe King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,\\r\\nThe news of thy success, and when he reads\\r\\nThy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,\\r\\nHis wonders and his praises do contend\\r\\nWhich should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,\\r\\nIn viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,\\r\\nHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\\r\\nNothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\\r\\nStrange images of death. As thick as tale\\r\\nCame post with post; and everyone did bear\\r\\nThy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,\\r\\nAnd pour’d them down before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nANGUS.\\r\\nWe are sent\\r\\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\\r\\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\\r\\nNot pay thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,\\r\\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\\r\\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\\r\\nFor it is thine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nWhat, can the devil speak true?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\\r\\nIn borrow’d robes?\\r\\n\\r\\nANGUS.\\r\\nWho was the Thane lives yet,\\r\\nBut under heavy judgement bears that life\\r\\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d\\r\\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\\r\\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\\r\\nHe labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;\\r\\nBut treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,\\r\\nHave overthrown him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n[_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:\\r\\nThe greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.\\r\\n[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\\r\\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\\r\\nPromis’d no less to them?\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nThat, trusted home,\\r\\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\\r\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:\\r\\nAnd oftentimes to win us to our harm,\\r\\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;\\r\\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray’s\\r\\nIn deepest consequence.—\\r\\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n[_Aside._] Two truths are told,\\r\\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\\r\\nOf the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.—\\r\\n[_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting\\r\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,\\r\\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success,\\r\\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:\\r\\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\\r\\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\\r\\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\\r\\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\\r\\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\\r\\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\\r\\nShakes so my single state of man\\r\\nThat function is smother’d in surmise,\\r\\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nLook, how our partner’s rapt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n[_Aside._] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me\\r\\nWithout my stir.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nNew honours come upon him,\\r\\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\\r\\nBut with the aid of use.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n[_Aside._] Come what come may,\\r\\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nGive me your favour. My dull brain was wrought\\r\\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\\r\\nAre register’d where every day I turn\\r\\nThe leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—\\r\\nThink upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,\\r\\nThe interim having weigh’d it, let us speak\\r\\nOur free hearts each to other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nVery gladly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nTill then, enough.—Come, friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.

Are not\\r\\nThose in commission yet return’d?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nMy liege,\\r\\nThey are not yet come back. But I have spoke\\r\\nWith one that saw him die, who did report,\\r\\nThat very frankly he confess’d his treasons,\\r\\nImplor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth\\r\\nA deep repentance. Nothing in his life\\r\\nBecame him like the leaving it; he died\\r\\nAs one that had been studied in his death,\\r\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow’d\\r\\nAs ’twere a careless trifle.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nThere’s no art\\r\\nTo find the mind’s construction in the face:\\r\\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built\\r\\nAn absolute trust.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus.\\r\\n\\r\\nO worthiest cousin!\\r\\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\\r\\nWas heavy on me. Thou art so far before,\\r\\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\\r\\nTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d;\\r\\nThat the proportion both of thanks and payment\\r\\nMight have been mine! only I have left to say,\\r\\nMore is thy due than more than all can pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThe service and the loyalty I owe,\\r\\nIn doing it, pays itself. Your Highness’ part\\r\\nIs to receive our duties: and our duties\\r\\nAre to your throne and state, children and servants;\\r\\nWhich do but what they should, by doing everything\\r\\nSafe toward your love and honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nWelcome hither:\\r\\nI have begun to plant thee, and will labour\\r\\nTo make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,\\r\\nThat hast no less deserv’d, nor must be known\\r\\nNo less to have done so, let me infold thee\\r\\nAnd hold thee to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nThere if I grow,\\r\\nThe harvest is your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nMy plenteous joys,\\r\\nWanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves\\r\\nIn drops of sorrow.—Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\\r\\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\\r\\nWe will establish our estate upon\\r\\nOur eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter\\r\\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which honour must\\r\\nNot unaccompanied invest him only,\\r\\nBut signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\\r\\nOn all deservers.—From hence to Inverness,\\r\\nAnd bind us further to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThe rest is labour, which is not us’d for you:\\r\\nI’ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful\\r\\nThe hearing of my wife with your approach;\\r\\nSo, humbly take my leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nMy worthy Cawdor!\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n[_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!—That is a step\\r\\nOn which I must fall down, or else o’erleap,\\r\\nFor in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!\\r\\nLet not light see my black and deep desires.\\r\\nThe eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,\\r\\nWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nDUNCAN.\\r\\nTrue, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;\\r\\nAnd in his commendations I am fed.\\r\\nIt is a banquet to me. Let’s after him,\\r\\nWhose care is gone before to bid us welcome:\\r\\nIt is a peerless kinsman.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth’s Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\n“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the\\r\\nperfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I\\r\\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\\r\\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\\r\\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which\\r\\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\\r\\ncoming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought\\r\\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\\r\\nmight’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\\r\\ngreatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\\r\\nWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\\r\\nIt is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness\\r\\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\\r\\nArt not without ambition, but without\\r\\nThe illness should attend it.

He’s here in double trust:\\r\\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\\r\\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\\r\\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\\r\\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\\r\\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\\r\\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\\r\\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\\r\\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\\r\\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\\r\\nStriding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d\\r\\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\\r\\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\\r\\nThat tears shall drown the wind.—I have no spur\\r\\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\\r\\nVaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself\\r\\nAnd falls on th’ other—\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nHe has almost supp’d.

Hath it slept since?\\r\\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\\r\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\\r\\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\\r\\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\\r\\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\\r\\nWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,\\r\\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\\r\\nLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”\\r\\nLike the poor cat i’ th’ adage?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nPr’ythee, peace!\\r\\nI dare do all that may become a man;\\r\\nWho dares do more is none.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWhat beast was’t, then,\\r\\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\\r\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\\r\\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\\r\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\\r\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\r\\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\\r\\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\\r\\nHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:\\r\\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\\r\\nHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums\\r\\nAnd dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\\r\\nHave done to this.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nIf we should fail?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWe fail?\\r\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\\r\\nAnd we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\\r\\n(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey\\r\\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\\r\\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\\r\\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\\r\\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\\r\\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\\r\\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\\r\\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\\r\\nTh’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\\r\\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\\r\\nOf our great quell?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nBring forth men-children only;\\r\\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\\r\\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,\\r\\nWhen we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two\\r\\nOf his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,\\r\\nThat they have done’t?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWho dares receive it other,\\r\\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\\r\\nUpon his death?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI am settled, and bend up\\r\\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\\r\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\\r\\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.

The King’s abed:\\r\\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure and\\r\\nSent forth great largess to your offices.\\r\\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\\r\\nBy the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\\r\\nIn measureless content.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nBeing unprepar’d,\\r\\nOur will became the servant to defect,\\r\\nWhich else should free have wrought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nAll’s well.\\r\\nI dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:\\r\\nTo you they have show’d some truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI think not of them:\\r\\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\\r\\nWe would spend it in some words upon that business,\\r\\nIf you would grant the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nAt your kind’st leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nIf you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,\\r\\nIt shall make honour for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nSo I lose none\\r\\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\\r\\nMy bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear,\\r\\nI shall be counsell’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nGood repose the while!\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nThanks, sir: the like to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\\r\\nShe strike upon the bell.

Come, let me clutch thee:—\\r\\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\\r\\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\\r\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\\r\\nAs this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall’st me the way that I was going;\\r\\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\\r\\nMine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before.—There’s no such thing.\\r\\nIt is the bloody business which informs\\r\\nThus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world\\r\\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\\r\\nThe curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,\\r\\nAlarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,\\r\\nWhose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design\\r\\nMoves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth,\\r\\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\\r\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now suits with it.—Whiles I threat, he lives.\\r\\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_A bell rings._]\\r\\n\\r\\nI go, and it is done.

Macbeth shall sleep no more!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\\r\\nYou do unbend your noble strength to think\\r\\nSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water,\\r\\nAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.—\\r\\nWhy did you bring these daggers from the place?\\r\\nThey must lie there: go carry them, and smear\\r\\nThe sleepy grooms with blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI’ll go no more:\\r\\nI am afraid to think what I have done;\\r\\nLook on’t again I dare not.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nInfirm of purpose!\\r\\nGive me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead\\r\\nAre but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood\\r\\nThat fears a painted devil.

Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on\\r\\nthe expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;\\r\\nhere you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’\\r\\nth’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear\\r\\nin both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough\\r\\nfor God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,\\r\\nequivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith,\\r\\nhere’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French\\r\\nhose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]\\r\\nKnock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold\\r\\nfor hell.

Lechery, sir, it provokes\\r\\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\\r\\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\\r\\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\\r\\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\\r\\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\\r\\nthe lie, leaves him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nPORTER.\\r\\nThat it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\\r\\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\\r\\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nIs thy master stirring?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nGood morrow, noble sir!\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nGood morrow, both!\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nNot yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\\r\\nI have almost slipp’d the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI’ll bring you to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\\r\\nBut yet ’tis one.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\\r\\nThis is the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nI’ll make so bold to call.\\r\\nFor ’tis my limited service.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Macduff._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nGoes the King hence today?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nHe does.

Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;\\r\\nAnd his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature\\r\\nFor ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\\r\\nSteep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers\\r\\nUnmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,\\r\\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\\r\\nCourage to make’s love known?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nHelp me hence, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nLook to the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\\r\\n\\r\\nDONALBAIN.\\r\\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\\r\\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\\r\\nLet’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nNor our strong sorrow\\r\\nUpon the foot of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nLook to the lady:—\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid,\\r\\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet,\\r\\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work\\r\\nTo know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:\\r\\nIn the great hand of God I stand; and thence\\r\\nAgainst the undivulg’d pretence I fight\\r\\nOf treasonous malice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nAnd so do I.\\r\\n\\r\\nALL.\\r\\nSo all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nLet’s briefly put on manly readiness,\\r\\nAnd meet i’ th’ hall together.\\r\\n\\r\\nALL.\\r\\nWell contented.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nWhat will you do? Let’s not consort with them:\\r\\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\\r\\nWhich the false man does easy. I’ll to England.\\r\\n\\r\\nDONALBAIN.\\r\\nTo Ireland, I. Our separated fortune\\r\\nShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,\\r\\nThere’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,\\r\\nThe nearer bloody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nThis murderous shaft that’s shot\\r\\nHath not yet lighted; and our safest way\\r\\nIs to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;\\r\\nAnd let us not be dainty of leave-taking,\\r\\nBut shift away. There’s warrant in that theft\\r\\nWhich steals itself, when there’s no mercy left.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. The same.

If there come truth from them\\r\\n(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)\\r\\nWhy, by the verities on thee made good,\\r\\nMay they not be my oracles as well,\\r\\nAnd set me up in hope? But hush; no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox,\\r\\n Ross, Lords, and Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nHere’s our chief guest.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nIf he had been forgotten,\\r\\nIt had been as a gap in our great feast,\\r\\nAnd all-thing unbecoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nTonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,\\r\\nAnd I’ll request your presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nLet your Highness\\r\\nCommand upon me, to the which my duties\\r\\nAre with a most indissoluble tie\\r\\nFor ever knit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nRide you this afternoon?\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nAy, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWe should have else desir’d your good advice\\r\\n(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)\\r\\nIn this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow.\\r\\nIs’t far you ride?\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nAs far, my lord, as will fill up the time\\r\\n’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,\\r\\nI must become a borrower of the night,\\r\\nFor a dark hour or twain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nFail not our feast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nMy lord, I will not.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWe hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d\\r\\nIn England and in Ireland; not confessing\\r\\nTheir cruel parricide, filling their hearers\\r\\nWith strange invention. But of that tomorrow,\\r\\nWhen therewithal we shall have cause of state\\r\\nCraving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,\\r\\nTill you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nAy, my good lord: our time does call upon’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI wish your horses swift and sure of foot;\\r\\nAnd so I do commend you to their backs.\\r\\nFarewell.—\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Banquo._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLet every man be master of his time\\r\\nTill seven at night; to make society\\r\\nThe sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself\\r\\nTill supper time alone: while then, God be with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSirrah, a word with you. Attend those men\\r\\nOur pleasure?\\r\\n\\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nThey are, my lord, without the palace gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nBring them before us.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be thus is nothing,\\r\\nBut to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo\\r\\nStick deep, and in his royalty of nature\\r\\nReigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;\\r\\nAnd, to that dauntless temper of his mind,\\r\\nHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour\\r\\nTo act in safety. There is none but he\\r\\nWhose being I do fear: and under him\\r\\nMy genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,\\r\\nMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\\r\\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\\r\\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\\r\\nThey hail’d him father to a line of kings:\\r\\nUpon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,\\r\\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\\r\\nThence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,\\r\\nNo son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,\\r\\nFor Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;\\r\\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;\\r\\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\\r\\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\\r\\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\\r\\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\\r\\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\\r\\nAnd champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nIt was, so please your Highness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWell then, now\\r\\nHave you consider’d of my speeches? Know\\r\\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\\r\\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\\r\\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\\r\\nIn our last conference, pass’d in probation with you\\r\\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,\\r\\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\\r\\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz’d\\r\\nSay, “Thus did Banquo.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nYou made it known to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI did so; and went further, which is now\\r\\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\\r\\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\\r\\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\\r\\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\\r\\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\\r\\nAnd beggar’d yours forever?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nWe are men, my liege.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\\r\\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\\r\\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\\r\\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d file\\r\\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\\r\\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\\r\\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\\r\\nHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive\\r\\nParticular addition, from the bill\\r\\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\\r\\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\\r\\nNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;\\r\\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\\r\\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\\r\\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\\r\\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\\r\\nWhich in his death were perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nI am one, my liege,\\r\\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\\r\\nHath so incens’d that I am reckless what\\r\\nI do to spite the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nAnd I another,\\r\\nSo weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,\\r\\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\\r\\nTo mend it or be rid on’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nBoth of you\\r\\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\r\\nTrue, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\\r\\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\\r\\nAgainst my near’st of life; and though I could\\r\\nWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,\\r\\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\\r\\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\\r\\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\\r\\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\\r\\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\\r\\nMasking the business from the common eye\\r\\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nWe shall, my lord,\\r\\nPerform what you command us.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nThough our lives—\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\\r\\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\\r\\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,\\r\\nThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight\\r\\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\\r\\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\\r\\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\\r\\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\\r\\nWhose absence is no less material to me\\r\\nThan is his father’s, must embrace the fate\\r\\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\\r\\nI’ll come to you anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\r\\nWe are resolv’d, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI’ll call upon you straight: abide within.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,\\r\\nIf it find heaven, must find it out tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nIs Banquo gone from court?\\r\\n\\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nAy, madam, but returns again tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nSay to the King, I would attend his leisure\\r\\nFor a few words.\\r\\n\\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nMadam, I will.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nNaught’s had, all’s spent,\\r\\nWhere our desire is got without content:\\r\\n’Tis safer to be that which we destroy,\\r\\nThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, my lord, why do you keep alone,\\r\\nOf sorriest fancies your companions making,\\r\\nUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died\\r\\nWith them they think on? Things without all remedy\\r\\nShould be without regard: what’s done is done.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWe have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it.\\r\\nShe’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\\r\\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\\r\\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\\r\\nBoth the worlds suffer,\\r\\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\\r\\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\\r\\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\\r\\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\\r\\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\\r\\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\\r\\nAfter life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;\\r\\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\\r\\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\\r\\nCan touch him further.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nCome on,\\r\\nGently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;\\r\\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\\r\\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\\r\\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\\r\\nUnsafe the while, that we\\r\\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\\r\\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\\r\\nDisguising what they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nYou must leave this.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\\r\\nThou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nBut in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThere’s comfort yet; they are assailable.\\r\\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\\r\\nHis cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons\\r\\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\\r\\nHath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done\\r\\nA deed of dreadful note.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWhat’s to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\\r\\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\\r\\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\\r\\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\\r\\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\\r\\nWhich keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow\\r\\nMakes wing to th’ rooky wood.\\r\\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\\r\\nWhiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.\\r\\nThou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;\\r\\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\\r\\nSo, pr’ythee, go with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter three Murderers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nBut who did bid thee join with us?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\nMacbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nHe needs not our mistrust; since he delivers\\r\\nOur offices and what we have to do\\r\\nTo the direction just.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nThen stand with us.\\r\\nThe west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.\\r\\nNow spurs the lated traveller apace,\\r\\nTo gain the timely inn; and near approaches\\r\\nThe subject of our watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\nHark! I hear horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\n[_Within._] Give us a light there, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nThen ’tis he; the rest\\r\\nThat are within the note of expectation\\r\\nAlready are i’ th’ court.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nHis horses go about.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\nAlmost a mile; but he does usually,\\r\\nSo all men do, from hence to the palace gate\\r\\nMake it their walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nA light, a light!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\n’Tis he.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nStand to’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nIt will be rain tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nLet it come down.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Assaults Banquo._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBANQUO.\\r\\nO, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\\r\\nThou mayst revenge—O slave!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Dies. Fleance escapes._]\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\nWho did strike out the light?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nWas’t not the way?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD MURDERER.\\r\\nThere’s but one down: the son is fled.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\r\\nWe have lost best half of our affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\r\\nWell, let’s away, and say how much is done.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords\\r\\n and Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nYou know your own degrees, sit down. At first\\r\\nAnd last the hearty welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nLORDS.\\r\\nThanks to your Majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nOurself will mingle with society,\\r\\nAnd play the humble host.\\r\\nOur hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,\\r\\nWe will require her welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nPronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\\r\\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter first Murderer to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nSee, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.\\r\\nBoth sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure\\r\\nThe table round. There’s blood upon thy face.\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDERER.\\r\\n’Tis Banquo’s then.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\n’Tis better thee without than he within.\\r\\nIs he dispatch’d?\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDERER.\\r\\nMy lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;\\r\\nYet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:\\r\\nIf thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDERER.\\r\\nMost royal sir,\\r\\nFleance is ’scap’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThen comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;\\r\\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\\r\\nAs broad and general as the casing air:\\r\\nBut now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in\\r\\nTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDERER.\\r\\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\\r\\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\\r\\nThe least a death to nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThanks for that.\\r\\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled\\r\\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\\r\\nNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow\\r\\nWe’ll hear, ourselves, again.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Murderer._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nMy royal lord,\\r\\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\\r\\nThat is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,\\r\\n’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\\r\\nFrom thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\\r\\nMeeting were bare without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nSweet remembrancer!—\\r\\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite,\\r\\nAnd health on both!\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nMay’t please your Highness sit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nHere had we now our country’s honour roof’d,\\r\\nWere the grac’d person of our Banquo present;\\r\\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness\\r\\nThan pity for mischance!\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nHis absence, sir,\\r\\nLays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness\\r\\nTo grace us with your royal company?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThe table’s full.\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nHere is a place reserv’d, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWhere?\\r\\n\\r\\nLENNOX.\\r\\nHere, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWhich of you have done this?\\r\\n\\r\\nLORDS.\\r\\nWhat, my good lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nThou canst not say I did it. Never shake\\r\\nThy gory locks at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nGentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nSit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,\\r\\nAnd hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;\\r\\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\\r\\nHe will again be well. If much you note him,\\r\\nYou shall offend him, and extend his passion.\\r\\nFeed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nAy, and a bold one, that dare look on that\\r\\nWhich might appal the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nO proper stuff!\\r\\nThis is the very painting of your fear:\\r\\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which you said,\\r\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts\\r\\n(Impostors to true fear), would well become\\r\\nA woman’s story at a winter’s fire,\\r\\nAuthoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all’s done,\\r\\nYou look but on a stool.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nPr’ythee, see there!\\r\\nBehold! look! lo! how say you?\\r\\nWhy, what care I?

Ay, and wisely too;\\r\\nFor ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,\\r\\nTo hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,\\r\\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\\r\\nThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key\\r\\n(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\\r\\nWhat ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\\r\\nBut, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d\\r\\nHis presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,\\r\\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestows himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nLORD.\\r\\nThe son of Duncan,\\r\\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\\r\\nLives in the English court and is receiv’d\\r\\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\\r\\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\\r\\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\\r\\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\\r\\nTo ratify the work), we may again\\r\\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\\r\\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\\r\\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now.

Some holy angel\\r\\nFly to the court of England, and unfold\\r\\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\r\\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\\r\\nUnder a hand accurs’d!\\r\\n\\r\\nLORD.\\r\\nI’ll send my prayers with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT IV\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.

But I shall crave your pardon.\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\\r\\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\\r\\nYet grace must still look so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nI have lost my hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\\r\\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\\r\\nWithout leave-taking?—I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\\r\\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\\r\\nWhatever I shall think.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\\r\\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\\r\\nThe title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:\\r\\nI would not be the villain that thou think’st\\r\\nFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nBe not offended:\\r\\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\\r\\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\\r\\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\\r\\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\\r\\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,\\r\\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\\r\\nShall have more vices than it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nWhat should he be?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\\r\\nThat, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth\\r\\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\\r\\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar’d\\r\\nWith my confineless harms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nNot in the legions\\r\\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d\\r\\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nI grant him bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\\r\\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\\r\\nThat has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,\\r\\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\\r\\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\\r\\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\\r\\nAll continent impediments would o’erbear,\\r\\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\\r\\nThan such an one to reign.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nBoundless intemperance\\r\\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\\r\\nTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\\r\\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.\\r\\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\\r\\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\\r\\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\\r\\nFinding it so inclin’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nWith this there grows\\r\\nIn my most ill-compos’d affection such\\r\\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\\r\\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\\r\\nDesire his jewels, and this other’s house:\\r\\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nThis avarice\\r\\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\\r\\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\\r\\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\\r\\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\\r\\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other graces weigh’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\\r\\nAs justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,\\r\\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\\r\\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\\r\\nI have no relish of them; but abound\\r\\nIn the division of each several crime,\\r\\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\\r\\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\\r\\nUproar the universal peace, confound\\r\\nAll unity on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nO Scotland, Scotland!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\\r\\nI am as I have spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nFit to govern?\\r\\nNo, not to live.—O nation miserable,\\r\\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\\r\\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\\r\\nBy his own interdiction stands accus’d,\\r\\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\\r\\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\\r\\nOft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,\\r\\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\\r\\nThese evils thou repeat’st upon thyself\\r\\nHave banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,\\r\\nThy hope ends here!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nMacduff, this noble passion,\\r\\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\\r\\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\\r\\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\\r\\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\\r\\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\\r\\nI put myself to thy direction, and\\r\\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\\r\\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\\r\\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\\r\\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\\r\\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\\r\\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\\r\\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\\r\\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\\r\\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\\r\\nIs thine and my poor country’s to command:\\r\\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\\r\\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\\r\\nNow we’ll together, and the chance of goodness\\r\\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\\r\\n’Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nWell; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\\r\\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\\r\\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nI thank you, doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Doctor._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nWhat’s the disease he means?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\n’Tis call’d the evil:\\r\\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\\r\\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\\r\\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\\r\\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\\r\\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\\r\\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\\r\\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\\r\\nPut on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,\\r\\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\\r\\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\\r\\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\\r\\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\\r\\nThat speak him full of grace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Ross.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nSee, who comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\\r\\nThe means that makes us strangers!\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nSir, amen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nStands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nAlas, poor country,\\r\\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\\r\\nBe call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\\r\\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\\r\\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\\r\\nAre made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems\\r\\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell\\r\\nIs there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives\\r\\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\\r\\nDying or ere they sicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nO, relation\\r\\nToo nice, and yet too true!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nWhat’s the newest grief?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nThat of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;\\r\\nEach minute teems a new one.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nHow does my wife?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nWhy, well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nAnd all my children?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nWell too.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nThe tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\\r\\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\\r\\nWhich was to my belief witness’d the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.\\r\\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doff their dire distresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nBe’t their comfort\\r\\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\\r\\nAn older and a better soldier none\\r\\nThat Christendom gives out.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nWould I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\\r\\nThat would be howl’d out in the desert air,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nWhat concern they?\\r\\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\\r\\nDue to some single breast?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nNo mind that’s honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\\r\\nPertains to you alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nIf it be mine,\\r\\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\\r\\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\\r\\nThat ever yet they heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nHumh! I guess at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nYour castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes\\r\\nSavagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner\\r\\nWere, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,\\r\\nTo add the death of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nMerciful heaven!—\\r\\nWhat, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.\\r\\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\\r\\nWhispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nMy children too?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nWife, children, servants, all\\r\\nThat could be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nAnd I must be from thence!\\r\\nMy wife kill’d too?\\r\\n\\r\\nROSS.\\r\\nI have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nBe comforted:\\r\\nLet’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nHe has no children.—All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?\\r\\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\\r\\nAt one fell swoop?\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nDispute it like a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nI shall do so;\\r\\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were,\\r\\nThat were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\\r\\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\\r\\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACDUFF.\\r\\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\\r\\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\\r\\nWithin my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,\\r\\nHeaven forgive him too!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALCOLM.\\r\\nThis tune goes manly.\\r\\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\\r\\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\\r\\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;\\r\\nThe night is long that never finds the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT V\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nI have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your\\r\\nreport. When was it she last walked?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nSince his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her\\r\\nbed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\\r\\nfold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to\\r\\nbed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nA great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of\\r\\nsleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,\\r\\nbesides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,\\r\\nhave you heard her say?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nThat, sir, which I will not report after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nYou may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nNeither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast\\r\\nasleep. Observe her; stand close.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nHow came she by that light?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nWhy, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her\\r\\ncommand.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nYou see, her eyes are open.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nAy, but their sense are shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nWhat is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I\\r\\nhave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nYet here’s a spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nHark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\\r\\nremembrance the more strongly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t.\\r\\nHell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\\r\\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who\\r\\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nDo you mark that?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands\\r\\nne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all\\r\\nwith this starting.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nGo to, go to. You have known what you should not.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what\\r\\nshe has known.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nHere’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will\\r\\nnot sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nI would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nWell, well, well.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nPray God it be, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nThis disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have\\r\\nwalked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you\\r\\nyet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nEven so?\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY MACBETH.\\r\\nTo bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,\\r\\ngive me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nWill she go now to bed?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nDirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR.\\r\\nFoul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\\r\\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\\r\\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\\r\\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.—\\r\\nGod, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\\r\\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\\r\\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\\r\\nMy mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight.\\r\\nI think, but dare not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\r\\nGood night, good doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

Within the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nHang out our banners on the outward walls;\\r\\nThe cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength\\r\\nWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie\\r\\nTill famine and the ague eat them up.\\r\\nWere they not forc’d with those that should be ours,\\r\\nWe might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\\r\\nAnd beat them backward home.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_A cry of women within._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is that noise?\\r\\n\\r\\nSEYTON.\\r\\nIt is the cry of women, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nI have almost forgot the taste of fears.\\r\\nThe time has been, my senses would have cool’d\\r\\nTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\\r\\nWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\\r\\nAs life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;\\r\\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\\r\\nCannot once start me.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Seyton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherefore was that cry?\\r\\n\\r\\nSEYTON.\\r\\nThe Queen, my lord, is dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nShe should have died hereafter.\\r\\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\\r\\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\\r\\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\\r\\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\\r\\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\\r\\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\\r\\nLife’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,\\r\\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\\r\\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\\r\\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\\r\\nSignifying nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSENGER.\\r\\nGracious my lord,\\r\\nI should report that which I say I saw,\\r\\nBut know not how to do’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nWell, say, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSENGER.\\r\\nAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,\\r\\nI look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\\r\\nThe wood began to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nLiar, and slave!\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSENGER.\\r\\nLet me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.\\r\\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\\r\\nI say, a moving grove.\\r\\n\\r\\nMACBETH.\\r\\nIf thou speak’st false,\\r\\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\\r\\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\\r\\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.—\\r\\nI pull in resolution; and begin\\r\\nTo doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,\\r\\nThat lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood\\r\\nDo come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood\\r\\nComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—\\r\\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\\r\\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\\r\\nI ’gin to be aweary of the sun,\\r\\nAnd wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—\\r\\nRing the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!\\r\\nAt least we’ll die with harness on our back.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE VI.

Either thou, Macbeth,\\r\\nOr else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,\\r\\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\\r\\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\\r\\nSeems bruited.

To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
